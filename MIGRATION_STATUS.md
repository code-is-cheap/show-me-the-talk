# Migration Status Report

## Successfully Migrated ‚úÖ

### Documentation
- All documentation files from backup successfully migrated
- No conflicts with existing docs
- Structure preserved and integrated

### Working Tests (Existing)
- `tests/unit/tui/` - All TUI tests passing (33 tests)
- `tests/integration/cli.test.ts` - CLI integration tests passing (15 tests)
- Core functionality tests are working correctly

## Issues Found ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Migrated Tests Need API Updates
The migrated tests from the backup are written for an older API version and need updates:

1. **Import Path Issues**
   - `TUIComponents.test.ts` references non-existent `TUIState` component
   - Some tests use old import paths instead of `@/` alias

2. **API Mismatches**
   - `ConversationFilter.test.ts` - API changes in search and categorization
   - Domain model tests - Some method signatures have changed
   - Rendering tests - Output format expectations don't match current implementation

3. **Mock Issues**
   - `TUIService.test.ts` was updated to fix TTY mocking
   - Some integration tests reference old class names

## Current Test Status

### Passing Tests (48 total)
- TUI unit tests: 33/33 ‚úÖ
- Integration tests: 15/15 ‚úÖ

### Failing Tests (64 from migration)
- Need API compatibility updates
- Not blocking core functionality

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Keep working functionality)
1. ‚úÖ Keep existing working tests
2. ‚úÖ Use migrated documentation as-is
3. üîÑ Gradually fix migrated tests as needed

### Future (Incremental fixes)
1. Update import paths in migrated tests
2. Fix API mismatches in domain tests
3. Update rendering test expectations
4. Fix integration test mocks

## Migration Value

### High Value ‚úÖ
- **Documentation**: Complete documentation set restored
- **Test Structure**: Good test organization patterns
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive test scenarios for future reference

### Medium Value ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Tests**: Need updates but provide good reference for expected behavior
- **Examples**: Help understand intended API usage

## Conclusion

‚úÖ **Migration Successful for Documentation**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Tests Need Incremental Updates**
‚úÖ **Core Functionality Unaffected**

The migration achieved its primary goal of restoring documentation and providing a foundation for comprehensive testing. The failing tests serve as a good reference for expected behavior and can be updated incrementally as needed.
