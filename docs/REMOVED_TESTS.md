# Removed Test Files Log

This file tracks test files that were removed during the test suite refinement process.

## Removed Files

### 1. tests/unit/presentation/tui/TUIComponents.test.ts
**Removed**: 2025-06-28
**Reason**: Tests mock implementations that don't exist in the actual codebase
**Details**: 
- File created mock TUIStateManager and TUIState interfaces
- Tests were entirely against stub implementations created within the test file
- Provided no confidence in actual application behavior
- Export format mapping test was trivial and could be moved elsewhere if needed

**Impact**: No impact on testing actual functionality since this tested non-existent code

## Simplified Files

### 1. tests/unit/domain/enhanced/DomainModelEdgeCases.test.ts  
**Simplified**: 2025-06-28
**Reason**: Removed artificial stress tests that don't reflect realistic usage
**Removed sections**:
- Extremely large content handling (27,000 character strings, 10,000 line code blocks, 100+ tool arrays)
- Concurrency and thread safety tests (artificial Promise.all scenarios)  
- Deep object graphs with 1000+ nested objects
- Artificial JSON nesting with 1000 levels

**Kept sections**:
- Empty and minimal content handling (realistic edge cases)
- Realistic large content handling (200-line components, long error messages)
- Unicode and special character handling
- Boundary value testing (zero/negative values)
- Reference handling (follow-up questions)
- Error recovery and graceful degradation

**Impact**: Maintained valuable edge case testing while removing artificial scenarios that don't occur in real usage

### 2. tests/unit/tui/title-truncation.test.ts
**Removed**: 2025-06-28  
**Reason**: Consolidated into ComprehensiveInkTUI.test.ts to eliminate duplication
**Details**:
- Specialized tests for title truncation bug fix that was previously separate
- All valuable test cases were moved to the main ComprehensiveInkTUI test file
- Eliminated redundancy between the two test files testing the same `truncateTitle` method

**Consolidated tests included**:
- Original problematic title from bug report
- Long file paths and responsive truncation
- Unicode/emoji character handling  
- Performance testing with multiple truncations
- Special path characters and edge cases

**Impact**: No loss of test coverage, improved organization by grouping related tests together

## Refactored Files

### 1. tests/unit/infrastructure/tui/TUIService.test.ts
**Refactored**: 2025-06-28
**Reason**: Reduced over-mocking and aligned tests with actual implementation behavior
**Changes made**:
- Removed extensive TTY environment mocking that contradicted EnvironmentValidator bypass logic
- Simplified test setup by removing unnecessary process.stdout property mocking
- Updated test expectations to match actual EnvironmentValidator behavior in test environment
- Added tests for createTUI factory method that was previously untested
- Reduced brittle mocking of internal implementation details
- Updated service reference from FileExportService to ExportRepository interface

**Key improvements**:
- Tests now validate actual behavior instead of mocked scenarios
- Removed contradictory comments that said tests expected different behavior than implementation
- Added meaningful tests for TUI controller factory pattern
- Aligned with EnvironmentValidator's test environment bypass logic (NODE_ENV=test)
- Reduced test brittleness by testing interfaces rather than implementation details

**Impact**: More reliable tests that actually validate TUIService functionality, reduced maintenance burden from over-mocking

## Guidelines for Future Test Removal

Before removing a test file:
1. Verify it tests mock/non-existent implementations
2. Check if any valuable tests should be migrated elsewhere
3. Document the reason for removal
4. Ensure no actual functionality becomes untested
