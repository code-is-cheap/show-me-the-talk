## Summary

All three core entry points show **IDENTICAL** content between the package build and current dist build. This indicates:

- Build process is consistent and reproducible
- No drift between package version and current codebase
- Core functionality remains stable across builds
- No structural or functional differences detected

## Analysis

The identical comparisons suggest that:
1. The build pipeline is working correctly
2. There are no untracked changes affecting core functionality
3. The current dist/ directory accurately reflects the expected build output
4. Package integrity is maintained
